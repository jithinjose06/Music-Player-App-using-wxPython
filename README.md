# Music-Player-App-using-wxPython

I did this project to get familiar with python GUI toolkit - wxPython.

This serves as a part of another project which aims at making this app downloadable on a website and track the number of downloads.

PyInstaller is used to make this app a standalone version.

Just a basic music player app with the following features: Play, Pause, Load, Stop, Seek.

GUI needs to be improved.
